### Installation

Beyond the Python Anaconda distribution, no other libraries should be required to run the code in this section. Python version 3.* should work without a hitch with this code.

### Project Motivation

This project will examine the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to answer the subsequent questions:
1. Which 10 nations are the highest ranking in the survey? and what kind of jobs do they have professionally?
2. Which nations are the most welcoming of remote work?
3. In what ways are work satisfaction, career happiness, and stackoverflow distributed? What insights does this distribution offer?
